# minecraft-world-downloader
A Minecraft world downloader that works as a proxy server between the client and the server to read & save chunk data. Download multiplayer worlds by connecting to them and walking around. Chunks can be sent back to the client to extend the render distance.

This is an unofficial fork which adds support for 1.21.2, 1.21.3 and 1.21.4.
